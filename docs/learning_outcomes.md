## Summary of Progress

The NoBl Programming Language project provides comprehensive coverage of all seven learning outcomes for the Advanced Software Engineering course. While some outcomes (particularly LO1-LO3 and LO6) are already being addressed through the completed lexer implementation and ongoing parser development, others (LO4, LO5, and LO7) are planned for later phases of the project.

The current implementation demonstrates professional standards, personal leadership, and architectural thinking, with detailed plans in place to address the remaining learning outcomes. As the project progresses through the parser, evaluator, and optimization phases, additional evidence will be generated to demonstrate mastery of all learning outcomes.

By project completion in Week 18, the NoBl language implementation will provide substantial evidence for proficiency in all seven learning outcomes, demonstrating advanced software engineering capabilities across the full spectrum of requirements.
