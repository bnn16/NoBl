## Research Topic & Motivation

My research will focus on the design and implementation of programming languages, specifically to support the development of my NoBl ("No Bloat") programming language project. This research falls under the first driver category - gathering new knowledge to move a project forward. 

The NoBl project aims to create a lightweight, efficient interpreted programming language with a functional paradigm that prioritizes simplicity and performance. To successfully implement this language from scratch (including lexer, parser, AST, and hopefully a compiler), I need to deepen my understanding of language design principles, implementation techniques, and performance optimization strategies.

## Problem Statement

Creating a programming language involves complex technical challenges that require specialized knowledge across multiple domains of computer science. The NoBl language project faces several key challenges:

1. Designing a functional language that maintains simplicity while providing powerful features
2. Implementing efficient lexing and parsing mechanisms for the language syntax
3. Creating a compiler and optimizing it
4. Ensuring memory safety and security by design
5. Determining the optimal implementation language (C vs Go) for the language toolchain

Without proper research into these areas, the project risks producing a language that fails to meet its core "No Bloat" philosophy or encounters significant technical obstacles during implementation.

## Research Questions

**Main Research Question:**
How can I design and implement a lightweight functional programming language that prioritizes performance and simplicity while avoiding unnecessary complexity?

**Sub-questions:**
1. What core language features should be included to support a functional paradigm while maintaining simplicity?
2. What lexer and parser implementation approaches offer the best balance of simplicity and performance?
4. What memory management strategies will provide safety without introducing significant overhead?
5. What design patterns in existing lightweight languages can inform NoBl's development?
6. What are the comparative advantages of using C versus Go for implementing the language toolchain?

## Research Methods (DOT Framework)

I will employ the following research methods from the DOT Framework:

### Library Research
* **Literature Study**: Examine academic papers and books on compiler design, language implementation, and virtual machines
* **Design Pattern Study**: Analyze design patterns used in successful lightweight languages (e.g., Lua, JavaScript)
* **Comparative Analysis**: Compare implementation approaches and language features across existing programming languages

### Lab Research  
* **Prototyping**: Create minimal prototypes of key components (lexer, parser, etc.) to test concepts
* **Benchmarking**: Measure performance characteristics of different implementation approaches
* **Code Analysis**: Analyze source code of open-source language implementations

### Showroom Research
* **Requirement Analysis**: Evaluate potential language features against the project's core philosophy
* **Best Practice Review**: Identify best practices in language design and implementation

## Deliverables

This research will produce the following deliverables:

1. A comprehensive language design document outlining:
   - Core syntax and semantic features
   - Type system design
   - Execution model

2. A technical architecture document detailing:
   - Lexer and parser implementation approach
   - AST structure and design
   - Compiler design and optimization strategies
   - Justification for implementation language selection (C vs Go)

3. A set of prototype implementations demonstrating key concepts:
   - Basic lexer and parser prototype
   - Simple AST implementation
   - Minimal Compiler PoC

4. A roadmap for full implementation with:
   - Development phases
   - Testing strategies
   - Performance benchmarking plan

## Time Estimation

| Research Activity | Estimated Time |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Literature review and existing language analysis | ~20-40 hours |
| Review other language repos and how they work | ~10 hours |
| Design pattern analysis and language feature evaluation | ~15 hours |
| Prototyping key components | ~25 hours |
| Benchmarking and analysis | ~10 hours |
| Documentation preparation | ~20 hours |
| **Total** | **~+100 hours** |

## Conclusion

This research plan provides a structured approach to gathering the knowledge needed to successfully implement the NoBl programming language. By systematically investigating language design principles, implementation techniques, and optimization strategies, I will develop the expertise required to create a language that truly embodies the "No Bloat" philosophy while delivering on its promises of simplicity and performance. The research will directly contribute to the success of my individual project by providing essential insights and helping me make informed design decisions.
