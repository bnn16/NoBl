|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|

*Note: This portfolio is a living document that will be updated throughout the semester as projects progress and new professional products are developed.*

## Introduction
This document serves as the central navigation hub for my Advanced Software Engineering semester's portfolio, providing an overview of my projects and learning outcomes while directing to detailed documentation. 

The portfolio demonstrates my progress in both my group project and my individual project (NoBl programming language).

## Reading Guide
*Note: This portfolio is a living document that will be updated throughout the semester as projects progress so some of the files might not be available at the moment of reading*

This portfolio consists of the following key documents that will be delivered throughout the semester:

1. **Project Plan** - Outlines the scope, objectives, research questions, timeline, and resource requirements for individual project. Includes key milestones and deliverables.

2. **Research Plan and Process Implementation** - Details my research methodology using the DOT framework, research questions, findings, and how these informed the design and implementation decisions for NoBl language development.

3. **Implementation Details** - Technical documentation of the NoBl language implementation, including lexer, parser, AST design, compiler architecture ( Hopefully will have time for a full compiler ). Contains code samples and architectural diagrams.

4. **Design Documentation** - Explores the design decisions behind NoBl, including language syntax, semantics, type system, and memory management approach. Includes rationale for functional paradigm choices.

5. **My Part in the Group Project** - Details my part in the group project and all the things I did throughout the semester.


## Projects Overview

### Individual Project: NoBl Programming Language
NoBl (No Bloat) is a lightweight, efficient interpreted programming language focusing on simplicity and performance. Following a functional paradigm, the project involves developing a complete language implementation, including lexer, parser, AST, compiler, and virtual machine.

*For more details on the NoBl language concept, architecture, and development approach, refer to the Project Plan document.*

### Group Project: Eviden Business-IT Alignment Game
The project delivers an interactive, Kahoot/Tinder-style game facilitating business-IT alignment for management teams. The cloud-deployed solution enables players to participate remotely on various devices, with multi-language support and secure data persistence. The game visualizes mismatches between business models and IT systems, helping organizations optimize IT costs through informed decision-making.

*For more details on the Eviden Business-IT Alignment Game, refer to the My Part in the Group Project document.*

## Reflection and Forward Planning

### Current Progress
I am in the early stages of the NoBl language project, focusing on research and design. The project provides an excellent opportunity to apply and demonstrate the learning outcomes through practical implementation.

*For a detailed reflection on my progress, challenges, and insights, refer to the Research Plan and Process Implementation document.*

### Next Steps
For the upcoming sprints, I plan to:
1. Complete the detailed language design document
2. Implement a basic lexer and parser
3. Set up the development environment and CI/CD pipeline
4. Begin work on the interpreter implementation

### Areas for Improvement
To reach proficient levels across all learning outcomes, I need to:
1. Strengthen my knowledge of interpreter and compiler design principles
2. Develop a more comprehensive understanding of cloud integration possibilities
3. Create more detailed plans for security testing and validation
4. Explore opportunities to apply DevOps principles more thoroughly in the development process
