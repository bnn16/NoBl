# NoBl Programming Language

## Introduction

NoBl (No Bloat) is a lightweight, efficient interpreted programming language focusing on simplicity and performance. Following a functional paradigm, the project involves developing a complete language implementation, including lexer, parser, AST, compiler, and virtual machine.

The core philosophy of NoBl is to provide developers with a tool that minimizes unnecessary overhead, allowing for rapid development and efficient execution.

## Current Status

**Current Phase:** Parser Implementation (Week 8/18)

The project has completed the lexical analysis phase and is now focused on implementing the parser component. The lexer can successfully tokenize NoBl source code, and development is underway on a recursive descent parser with Pratt parsing for expressions.

### Completed Components:
- ‚úÖ Token system implementation
- ‚úÖ Lexical analyzer (lexer)
- ‚úÖ Basic REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for testing
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive lexer testing
- ‚úÖ Web-based REPL for showcasing

### In Progress:
- üîÑ AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) design
- üîÑ Recursive descent parser implementation
- üîÑ Pratt parsing for expressions

## Language Syntax

NoBl uses a clean, C-style syntax that will be familiar to most programmers:

```
// Variable binding
const x = 5;

// Function definition
const add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};

// Function call
const result = add(5, 10);

// Conditional
if (result > 10) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}
```

### Key Language Features

## Usage

### Build

Before using NoBl, build the executable using the included build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will create the `NoBl` executable in the current directory and set up necessary files.

### Interactive REPL

Start the interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) to experiment with NoBl:

```bash
./NoBl
```

Or if you haven't built the executable yet:

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Execute a File

You can execute a NoBl program from a file:

```bash
./NoBl path/to/your/program.nobl
```

Example program (`test.nobl`):

```
let five = 5;
let ten = 10;
let add = fn(x, y) { x + y };
let result = add(five, ten);
result;
```

The repository includes several example files:
- `test.nobl` - A simple test program
- `examples.nobl` - A comprehensive showcase of language features

### Web REPL

NoBl includes a web-based REPL that you can use to showcase the language in a browser:

```bash
go run main.go --web
```

Then open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

You can specify a different port if needed:

```bash
go run main.go --web 3000
```

The web REPL provides a user-friendly interface with the following features:

- Syntax highlighting for code input
- Examples of NoBl code that you can run with a click
- Multi-line code editor
- Share button to create shareable code links
- Documentation and language information tabs
- Light and dark themes for comfortable coding

You can also use the included shell script to start the web REPL:

```bash
./start_web_repl.sh
# Or with a custom port:
./start_web_repl.sh 3000
```

- **Functional Paradigm**: Functions are first-class citizens
- **Immutability**: Encourages immutable data patterns through `const` declarations
- **No OOP Bloat**: Focus on simplicity without classes and inheritance hierarchies
- **Minimal Syntax**: Only essential language constructs

## Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Research & Design | Weeks 1-4 | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Lexical Analysis | Weeks 5-8 | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Parsing | Weeks 9-12 | üîÑ In Progress |
| Evaluation & Standard Library | Weeks 13-14 | ‚è±Ô∏è Pending |
| Optimization | Weeks 15-16 | ‚è±Ô∏è Pending |
| Documentation & Distribution | Weeks 17-18 | ‚è±Ô∏è Pending |

## Running NoBl

Currently, you can run the NoBl REPL to experiment with the lexer:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will start an interactive session where you can type NoBl code and see the tokens produced by the lexer.

## Development

### Technology Stack
- **Implementation Language**: Go
- **Testing**: Go's built-in testing framework
- **Development Environment**: Standard Go toolchain

### Project Structure
- `token/` - Token definitions and utilities
- `lexer/` - Lexical analyzer implementation
- `repl/` - Interactive read-eval-print loop
- `parser/` - Parser implementation (in progress)
- `ast/` - Abstract Syntax Tree definitions (in progress)

## Future Work

After completing the parser, upcoming work includes:
- Interpreter/evaluator implementation
